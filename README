Thanks for taking a look at my game!

House Explorer is a Python-based text adventure game engine. 

The gamedata.xml file in the root directory is an example of what the Engine 
will read in. Feel free to customize to your heart's content.


This version:
	How about a complete re-write? After letting House_Explorer stagnate for some time,
I decided to scrap the complicated code that I had already written and go about 
this in a completely different manner. 
	Instead of hard-coding locations and events, everything is now read in from a XML 
configuration file. This way the inner workings of the program don't need to be visible 
to create the game, making this project a lot more reusable and testable.
	I also redid the structure of the project itself. Instead of trying to create my own
standards, I decided to adopt the Package/Module layout that most every Python package
uses.


To run:

1. Open up a terminal/command prompt window in the /House_Explorer/ folder.

2. Run the House_Explorer.py file by typing "python3 House_Explorer.py".

3. Enjoy!
