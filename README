House Explorer is a Python-based text adventure game engine. 

The gamedata.xml file in the root directory is an example of what the Engine 
will read in. Feel free to customize to your heart's content.

Commands to try:
	walk north and type "use lockpick on mailbox"
	type "inventory" to see your items

This version:
		A bunch of new features were added. The player can now pick up items
	in the environment and carry them around in their inventory. Items can
	also be used on other items in the inventory, but that feature is still in
	its fledgling stages. Using an item on an environment item can change
	the item's description, and add and remove items from the player's
	inventory.


To run:

1. Open up a terminal/command prompt window in the /House_Explorer/ folder.

2. Run the House_Explorer.py file by typing "python3 House_Explorer.py".

3. Enjoy!
